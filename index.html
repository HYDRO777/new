                                    <p class="p_modal">Naruto the starter series is better for me than the shippuden. I used to admire ninjas and naruto was an awesome anime featuring the ninjas. In fact, I actually watched naruto shippuden first(not the complete series, just until the sasuke itachi fight) and only then I realised that my friends, the so called naruto fans had been bragging about watching part two without watching the beginning, which I did too as they gave me the downloaded videos. But as soon as I realized there is something more to it, I soon switched to manga and it was possibly my best transition. Manga gave the story a lot more feelings, the art just gives me goosebumps as I have always been a fan of good art. The drawing is so captivating and the emotions are so powerful in the manga. Here are the reasons why I prefer part one over two: The term ninja had more meaning in part one, with their stealth, shuriken and traps, but in shippuden, they are just people who manipulate chakra and bring out visually feasting ninjutsu. Like bruce wayne suddenly decide to go iron man instead of batman one day(I totally love these 2 characters, but I was just pointing out the difference to get the clear picture). The characters are not overpowered in part 1. The second hokage was kind of the only person who could make water out of nowhere. But somehow in part 2, everyone had a boost in chakra reserves. The elders are respected. The sannin, lord third and kakashi were given special emphasis and the respect towards them by other ninja and even the author was evident. But these did not last in part 2. Tsunade has hardly had a fight, Orochimaru was killed multiple times and humiliated during the entire series. Kakashi became a forgotten legend. The author decided to go with fans on the rest of the story. Byakugan was awesome in part 1 but sharingan became everything in part 2. I wanna become the hokage became a mere forgotten catch phrase. And the centre of series became sasuke. And sasuke changed so much, with his arrogance which for for some reason isn’t cool at all, in fact was a disaster. The monsters of chunin exams, lee, neji, kankuro, temari etc were neglected. Rasengan and chidori used to be one time attacks due to chakra limits and due to their awesomeness as finishing blows. But in part 2, hundreds of shadow clones run around with rasengans without hitting anything. Sasuke and kakashi usually begin with chidori. Gamambunta reduced greatly in size and also, is not getting the respect it used to get. Same would go for manda. 9 tails was over powered. Remember how much chakra naruto gave to shinobi in war in addition to fighting multiple tailed beasts. Plot holes and plot armour were much more in part 2. The story towards the end was not planned beforehand by the author and the author lost control by the war. The so called twists were in fact new even to the author. There was no foreshadowing about anything. And most importantly, where did the becoming hokage go. I thought it was supposed to be the central theme of the manga. I kind of enjoyed everything upto pain arc. But the war saga and the new characters were all tiring. There was no character development nor world building. The kinkaku brothers were the worst for me. And trying to use our nostalgia and sentiment in part 1 by bringing up old scenes and flashbacks was, for me, a vague attempt at trying to use our sentiment. And neji being an insignificant character throughout part 2 made me feel nothing when died. Mangas change their nature over years as the authors themselves age and their thoughts change, but even giving that consideration, I would point out naruto shippuden as a tragedy of ruining a legendary series.(Reviw from Quora by Deva Dathan) (https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-Naruto-Naruto-Shippuden).<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto" target="_blank"><b>Naruto</b></a> </p>

            </h5>
            <p>There are a lot of anime about the slaying of demons. Almost too many, in fact. If someone was supposed to make an anime, but then forgot and had to quickly rush something together at the last minute, they’d make it about demon slaying. At this point it’s a little exhausting whenever a new demon-slaying anime gets announced, but it’s for this very reason that the series that work are especially effective. 

Koyoharu Gotouge’s Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba doesn’t just touch on familiar storylines and ideas, even its title is bland and vague. However, Demon Slayer turns out to be one of the most enjoyable new anime to come out in the past few years and it’s a very exciting addition to Netflix’s growing anime library.

Demon Slayer begins in an explosive manner that turns the relatively timid Tanjiro Kamado into a vengeful warrior after he experiences the worst kind of trial by fire. Demons attack Tanjiro’s family and turn his sister, Nezuko, into one of their kind. The newly orphaned Tanjiro meets a Demon Slayer and becomes committed to avenging his family’s death, taking down any evil creatures that he encounters, and cure his sister of her unfortunate fate. Tanjiro’s journey aligns himself with Zenitsu and Inosuke, two fellow budding fighters, and the lot experiences significant growth and challenging hardships the further they go. There’s also a very natural chemistry and sense of humor between this core group of characters, which helps balance out the anime’s more melodramatic moments. 

Tanjiro and his group go through the usual hurdles of training and battles as they learn and refine powerful abilities. Demon Slayer doesn’t cram too much into its first season and the majority of these episodes get a chance to breathe where the characters can properly express themselves and not be rushing from one battle to the next. 

Many of the battles against demons are spread across multiple episodes rather than a need to resolve each fight by the time that the credits roll. Demon Slayer is more concerned with characterization, for both its heroes and demons, so battles can mean more when they do happen. This means that some episodes are less productive than others, but it helps the series find its voice more quickly as a result.

It’s of course important to have protagonists that feel real and not just come across as anime stereotypes, but Demon Slayer especially excels with how it humanizes its villains. The episodes devote lots of time to who these demons were before their corruption, how they got like this, and what they sacrificed as a result. It’s a creative way to unify the heroes and the villains. This level of empathy doesn’t stop Tanjiro in his mission to eliminate these monsters, but it sometimes gives him pause as he considers how his sister is now in the same situation. 

Demon Slayer wants both Tanjiro and the audience to consider how some of these demons are just as innocent or in need of redemption as Nezuko. It’s a fascinating wrinkle that adds a deep vein of melancholy and pain to each of Tanjiro’s victories. So many anime of this nature celebrate the heroes’ successes over beastly creatures, which makes Demon Slayer’s contemplative attitude all the more gripping. Tanjiro and company aren’t interested in bragging rights or even that focused on becoming the strongest Demon Slayers. They merely want to achieve their personal goals and move on with their lives. It’s a refreshing perspective that helps ground these characters during their more exaggerated moments or the times that action overwhelms story.
